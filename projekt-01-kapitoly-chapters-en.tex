\chapter{NDP architecture}
NDP is a network architecture for datacenters with Clos topology.

The architecture includes switches and endpoints...

\section{Precedent solutions}
It was created to provide better latency than existing protocols for congestion control like Data Center TCP or Cut Payload.
Newer RDMA over Converged Ethernet v2 using Ethernet flow control in switches.

The reference implementation from original paper uses DPDK on Linux for end-host.
The part for switches was implemented as software switch, for NetFPGA hardware switch and in P4.

Congestion control - one receiver from many senders.
Spread the flow to multiple paths - huge reordering.

Inspired by Cut Payload design.
Two priority queues for data packets and returning headers in ratio 1:10.
NACK header returns instantly to notify the sender.

Phase effect.

\chapter{XDP}

%reader should know about the linux kernel, but not in this depth
\section{BPF}
When running in user-space, packets must be copied across the kernel/user-space protection boundary
history of creation of bpf

\section{XDP}
Based on eBPF language.
Runs in kernel.
Subset of C.
Must terminate
